          Cory is the best scrum master I worked with. He was able to save our team's time during our scrum planning and daily meeting, while keeping our performance to a constant pace. He was a great add to multiple teams, including ours. He helped us self organize, and deliver high quality features in each sprint. He was able to nudge the team into planning and executing successful sprints without making us feel any pressure. He was able to communicate and drive the team through the scrum process, and working as a catalyst to delivering more features. Cory has my highest recommendation when it comes to scrum masters that help teams deliver features faster.

          I never truly grasped the true power of Scrum and Agile until I had the pleasure of having Cory as my team's Scrum Master. Cory had his finger directly on the pulse of the team being a true “servant leader” Cory was always willing to jump into a quick 1 on 1 with me, always interested in how he could better serve the team. I regularly reached out to Cory seeking advice, particularly on the subject of team dynamics. He is able to analyze the team dynamics and find the perfect blend of scrum leadership and autonomy to match the team and help them do their best work.

          Working with Cory as our Scrum Master at Measurabl was truly a pleasure, and I can't recommend him enough. Cory's approach was focused on enabling developers to be self-organizing, giving us the autonomy to do our best work. He always kept the team well-informed and fostered a culture of trust.  Additionally, I learned so much from Cory regarding the Scrum process. His expertise and guidance were invaluable, and I gained a deeper understanding of agile methodologies thanks to him. Cory always facilitated our daily scrums and sprint retrospectives, creating an environment for open and honest communication and continuous improvement. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have worked with Cory, and I strongly recommend him for any Scrum Master role.
